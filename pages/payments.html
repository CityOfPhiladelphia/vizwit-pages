title: Payments
description: |
    <p>This dataset includes checks and ACH (direct deposit) payments
    made by the City during the fiscal year 2017, which runs from July 1st 2016 through June
    30th 2017. </p>

    <p>This dataset does not include all payments made by the City. Namely,
    salary and benefits payments are not included here, but information on City
    salaries can be found in the employee salaries and overtime dataset.</p>

    <p>This dataset cannot be accurately compared directly with the other financial
    and accounting reports released by the City. The date of the payments made in the
    dataset may not always match up with the fiscal year that the services were
    rendered, which is one of the reasons why an accurate comparison between
    various financial datasets cannot be made.</p>

    <p>Please note: This visualization shows data from the detailed city_payments_fy2017 dataset. For the
    aggregate payments data, which includes legal and security-sensitive payments,
     see city_payments_aggregates_fy2017.</p>
